- Hi, I’m @r0binsonCrusoe
- I’m interested in GIS, digital mapping, data science, and international development
- I’m currently learning python, django, geospatial analysis, mapping, and devops.
- I’m looking for a job that would allow me to use my geospatial python skills. 
- Check out my website here. It is built with django and I utilized postgres(postGIS), docker, tailwindcss, stripe, and an external photo printing API.
